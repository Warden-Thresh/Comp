    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    70:60:D9:2C:EE:88:7F:26:32:00:9D:A8:46:28:F9:C8:EB:29:C2:4E

    70:60:D9:2C:EE:88:7F:26:32:00:9D:A8:46:28:F9:C8:EB:29:C2:4E

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
